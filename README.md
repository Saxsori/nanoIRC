# Nano IRC Server üê≠

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is Internet servers that use a specific protocol through which individuals can hold real-time online conversations. This was my own implementation of the server before applying the IRC protocols. This server has been created to understand the socket programming and to study the select functionn behavior. It was the very beginning step on our own [IRC server](https://github.com/i99dev/ft_irc).

Each and every step was explained breifly in the comments on the top of each line, [please chcek them out]().

The following conditions have been succesfully handeled in this server:
- Unxpected disconnection ex.terminate of the terminal that run the client or closing it using ctrl-c.
- The server should be always running even if the client disconnect.
- Ctrl-C to terminate the server after usage without leaks.
